## A bit about me...
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a Data analyst based in Edmonton, Canada. 

My passion for data started 7 years ago when I was promoted to a new role as a Production Supervisor at a lubricant blending plant of a multinational oil and gas company. During my takeover period, I remember my predecessor training me on how he manually records every detail of the production activities during the month and then spent 5 days at the beginning of the month summing the figures together and creating the plant's performance report. I sat there thinking to myself that I was never going to work that way and since then, I haven't looked back. 

One of my proudest achievements was saving 4 days spent on manual reports by downloading data files from the ERP software in CSV formats, loading the data into Excel and creating a data model that helped to produce reports in a few hours.
