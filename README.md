## A bit about me...
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a Data analyst based in Edmonton, Canada. 

My passion for data started 7 years ago when I was promoted to a new role as a Production Supervisor at a lubricant blending plant of a multinational oil and gas company. During my takeover period, I remember my predecessor training me on how he manually records every detail of the production activities during the month and then spent 5 days at the beginning of the month summing the figures together and creating the plant's performance report. I sat there thinking to myself that I was never going to work that way and since then, I haven't looked back. 

One of my proudest achievements was saving 4 days spent on manual reports by downloading data files from the ERP software in CSV formats, loading the data into Excel and creating data models that helped to produce reports in a few hours.
